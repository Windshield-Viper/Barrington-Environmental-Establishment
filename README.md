# Barrington Environmental Establishment
This is the Barrington Environmental Establishment's website. It's currently hosted on Replit but we use GitHub for version control and so that we can have all our code in one place.

## Who we are
The Barrington Environment Establishment is a student-led climate action nonprofit aiming to BEE the change in Barrington, the East Bay, and Rhode Island as a whole. We host various events in our community and circulate a weekly newsletter.

## How you can help
Thank you for your consideration! You can sign up for our newsletter, participate in our events, or become a member. [Visit our website](https://bee.establishment.repl.co/) for more details!
